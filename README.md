# korome [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LFalch/korome.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LFalch/korome)

A game engine in Rust (previously Java) using [glium](https://github.com/tomaka/glium)

To use korome, add this to your Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies.korome]
git = "https://github.com/LFalch/korome.git"
```

Though right now, this crate is very unstable, and will probably be changing all the time.

## Documentation

[Read documentation](http://lfalch.github.io/korome/korome/) (it's lacking quite a bit at the crate level right now)
